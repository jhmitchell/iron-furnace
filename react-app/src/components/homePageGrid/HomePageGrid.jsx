            Welcome to the Cornwall Iron Furnace, Americaâ€™s most complete
            charcoal fueled ironmaking complex. The furnace operated from 1742
            to 1883 producing nearly 300 tons of iron each week at its peak in
            the late 18th century.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the Furnace stands as a symbol of Pennsylvania's industrial
            heritage and a tribute to the workers who helped make America a
            great industrial nation.
