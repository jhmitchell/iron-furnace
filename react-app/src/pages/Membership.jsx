            Cornwall Iron Furnace Associates, Inc. is a non-profit, 501(c)(3)
            educational organization, whose mission is to preserve and promote
            the history of the site and iron making in Pennsylvania. We are
            dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of the 18th and
            19th century ironmaking complex that once existed at Cornwall, PA.
            We are located in Cornwall Borough, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania.
            The furnace complex operated from 1742 to 1883. The furnace is the
            only surviving intact charcoal cold blast furnace in the Western
            Hemisphere. It retains its original heat exchangers, stack, and
            water wheel. The furnace complex includes the furnace, the
            ironmaster's mansion, the paymaster's office, the company store, and
            the workers' housing. The site is listed on the National Register of
            Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark.
